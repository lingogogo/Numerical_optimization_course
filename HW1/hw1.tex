\begin{enumerate}
 \item (30\%) For a single variable unimodal function $f \in [0, 1]$, we want to find its minimum.  We have introduced the binary search algorithm in the class.  But in each iteration, we need two function evaluations, $f(x_k)$ and $f(x_k+\epsilon)$.  Here is another type of algorithms, called ternary search. Figure \ref{fig1} illustrates the idea.  The initial triplet of $x$ values is $\{x_1, x_2, x_3\}$.

\begin{enumerate}
		\item (10\%) For the search direction, show that to find the minimum point, if $f(x_4)=f_{4a}$, the triplet $\{x_1,x_2,x_4\}$ is chosen for the next iteration. If $f(x_4)=f_{4b}$, the triplet $\{x_2, x_4, x_3\}$ is chosen. (Hint: use the property of unimodal.)
    \item (10\%) For either case, we want these three points keep the same ratio, which means
    $$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{a} = \frac{c}{b-c}.$$
    Show that under this condition, the ratio of $b/a=(\sqrt{5}+1)/2$, which is the golden ratio $\phi$. (So this algorithm is called the \emph{Golden-section search}).
    \item (10\%) If we let each iteration of the algorithm has two function evaluations, show the convergence rate of the Golden-section search is  $\phi^{-2}$.  (This means it is faster than the binary search algorithm under the same number of function evaluations.)

\item (15\%) Show that Newton's method for single variables is equivalent to build a quadratic model 
$$q(x) = f(x_k) + f'(x_k)(x-x_k) + \frac{f''(x_k)}{2}(x-x_k)^2$$
at the point $x_k$ and use the minimum point of $q(x)$ as the next point.  (Hint: to show the next point $x_{k+1} = x_k -f'(x_k)/f''(x_k)$)
